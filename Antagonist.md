## Antagonist

In terms of literary narrative, the antagonist is the opponent of the protagonist or focal character. The antagonist obstructs or puts obstacles in the way of the protagonist achieving his/her/its quest, goal, destination or destiny. In an agonistic model of narrative, such as that conceived by A. J. Greimas for example, which conceptualises the helper and the opponent as actantial contraries, the actantial role of opponent may be played by a single character, who may be human or non-human, or by a series of human or non-human characters. 

Drawing upon another binary distinction, that of friend and enemy, the antagonist may also be called the archenemy or arch-foe of the protagonist.

The term antagonist is derived from the Greek word _antagonistes_, meaning opponent, competitor or rival. The antagonist may be a character, group of characters, or an institution representing the difficulties and obstacles against which the protagonist must struggle. 

Employing a yet further dualism, that of hero versus villain, the former may be regarded as _protagonist_ and the latter as _antagonist_.

The antagonist may also represent a major threat or obstacle to the main character by their very existence, without necessarily actively targeting him or her.
