## Experience Design

RELATED TERMS: 

Nathan Shedroff defines experience Design as an approach to creating successful experiences for people in any medium which includes consideration and design in all three spatial dimensions, over time, all five common senses, and interactivity, as well as customer value, personal meaning, and emotional context. Experience design is not merely the design of Web pages or other interactive media or on-screen digital content but includes designed experiences in any medium, including spatial-environmental installations, print products, hard products, services, broadcast images and sounds, live performances and events. 

## Customer Experience in Experience Design

Colin Shaw and John Ivens note that the customer experience is a blend of a companyâ€™s physical performance and the emotion evoked, intuitively measured against customer expectation across all moment of contact.
