## Hero

**RELATED TERMS: Exhibition design; Narratology; Protagonist; Human Actantiality**

Joseph Campbell examines many of the world's heroic myths and stories. He ties the processes of transformation in those stories to the quest to know the truest self, a task which he avers takes much time.

"In mythos, the heroic attributes belong to both feminine and masculine, both to men and to women, and to children and creatures and spirits and sky and earth and the Self as well."


Typically, the hero is the protagonist of a story, the good guy/girl with whom the audience identifies, empathises and sympathises.
