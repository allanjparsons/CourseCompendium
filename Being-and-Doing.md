## Being and Doing (and Having)

**RELATED TERMS: Objects and Events; **

A narrative environment 'is' what it 'does'. Although constituted by materiality in the form of 'objects', a narrative environment 'is' an 'event'; it 'occurs', in a particular place, at a particular time for particular people. One could argue, and it is only an argument, that such an event 'has' meaning.
