## Ergodic

**RELATED TERMS: Aleatory**

The term ‘ergodic’ might be said to occupy a similar territory to that of aleatory. 

Bringing together two Greek roots, _ergon_ meaning work and _hodos_ meaning path, ergodic is a term borrowed from physics by Espen Aarseth (1997: 2) who uses it to suggest that a “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text” in the context of cybertextuality.
