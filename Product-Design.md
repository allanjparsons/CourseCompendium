## Product and Industrial Design

RELATED TERMS: 

Victor Papanek, writing in the early 1970s proposed that, 

"There are professions more harmful than industrial design, but only a very few of them. And possibly only one profession is phonier. Advertising design, in persuading people to buy things they don't need, with money they don't have, in order to impress others who don't care, is probably the phoniest field in existence today. Industrial design, by concocting the tawdry idiocies hawked by advertisers, comes a close second."

Since that time, product design has addressed many of the concerns which Papanek expressed. Critical product design, for example, focuses on maintenance, repair and upgradability of products, in order to foster new modes of ownership that transgress fashion and trends, and to contribute to the future design of more sustainable products.
