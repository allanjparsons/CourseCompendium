## Poetry and Poetics

RELATED TERMS:

Poetry drives from Greek term _poiesis_, meaning making, producing or creating. In the context of the design of narrative environment, the term poetics may be of more value because, while a narrative environemt may indeed contain poetry in the literary sense, as "literature that evokes a concentrated imaginative awareness of experience or a specific emotional response through language chosen and arranged for its meaning, sound, and rhythm", more usually a design will be aiming to create an emerging transmedia and transmodal poetics, transforming the features of poetry such as line, feet, metre, rhyme and rhythm into more general lietmotifs that can be carried across modia and modes of communication.
