A vocative expression is one in which a person is directly referred to in dialogue, for example, by their name, their job title or position or by a term of endearment, respect or disrespect.

In the context of writing, vocatives can serve several purpoases, such as, to help readers to keep track of who is saying what to whom; to enrich charactersâ€™ emotions by conveying a deeper sense of urgency, frustration, surprise or patience; or to show how characters relate to one other.

In the design of narrative environments, vocative expressions are often distributed across media, for example, a welcoming architectural threshold accompanied by a graphic sign reinforcing the invitation to enter. Once inside, the visitor or participant needs to be repeatedly addressed vocatively in order to be guided through the experience.
