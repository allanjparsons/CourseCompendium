## Thematic Apperception Tests

RELATED TERMS:

Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT) are used to try to understand an individual's needs and  
motivations. These tests consist of images that are ambiguous, yet provocative. Individuals are  
then asked to construct narratives using these images. Their motives and attitudes are then interpreted from  
the stories they create.
