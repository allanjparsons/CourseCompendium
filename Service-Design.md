## Service Design

RELATED TERMS: 

Service Design is the activity of planning and organising people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service, in order to improve its quality, the interaction between service provider and customers and the customerâ€™s experience. 


The design of the service may involve a re-organisation of the activities performed back office by the service provider and/or the re-design of time and place in which customers come in contact with the service.

Nathan Shedroff defines service design as the field concerned with the development of services to meet specific needs. These services may make use of different communication media, including online, telephone and in-person, may be automated and may use products as part of the service experience. A service usually includes a service ecology that allows the service operate successfully.
