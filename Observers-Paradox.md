## Observer’s paradox

**Related TERMS: Sociel Science; Science**

The phenomenon known as the observer's paradox is pervasive across the natural and social sciences. As Dale and Vinson express it, "[t]he observer’s paradox is the notion that intervention or measurement by an observer can directly impact (or coordinate with) the behaviour of the system being studied." In quantum mechanics, the problem of observation and measurement has produced a series of paradoxes, for example, observation may very well alter the rate at which subatomic particles decay. 

At larger scales, the observer’s paradox pervades cognition itself, for example, within individual cognitive processes such as speech production. A more commonly recognised sense of the paradox is that in the social sciences, one which has ubiquitous relevance at virtually every level of human behavioural measurement. A historically prominent articulation of the paradox is found in sociolinguistics with the studies of Labov in which it is found that the vernacular speech of a person being studied is altered by the presence of the observer. 

In short, the observer’s paradox refers to the paradox that it is not possible to observe something in the condition that it would be in if it were not being observed. This is a problem for anyone who wants to observe something in its ‘natural state’, since the very act of observing it may make it (anything from a virus to a human being) act differently.
