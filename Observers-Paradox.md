## Observer’s paradox

Related TERMS: 

Observer’s paradox refers to the paradox that it is not possible to observe something in the condition that it would be in if it were not being observed. This is a problem for anyone who wants to observe something in its ‘natural state’, since the very act of observing it may make it (anything from a virus to a human being) act differently.
