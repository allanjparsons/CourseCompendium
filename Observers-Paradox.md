## Observer’s paradox

Related TERMS: 

The phenomenon known as the observer's paradox is pervasive across the natural and social sciences. As ... explain it,

"The observer’s paradox is the notion that intervention or measurement by an observer can directly impact (or coordinate with) the behaviour of the system being studied. Some of the earliest interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest that all properties of a system cannot be known at any given time, and only through probabilities are we able to adequately conceive of possible states of a system at a given time. Yet, the very act of observing these states will result in measuring only one specific state of that system, when the system (pre-observation) may be best described as multiple probabilistic states simultaneously (e.g. Howard, 2004)."

This problem of observation and measurement has produced a series of paradoxes. For example, observation may very well alter the rate at which subatomic particles decay.

Scaling up, the observer’s paradox pervades cognition itself, holding even within individual cognitive processes such as speech production.

 a more commonly recognised sense of the paradox has won significant attention in the
social sciences. This form of the paradox is a prominent one, having ubiquitous relevance, at
virtually every level of human behavioural measurement. A historically prominent articulation
of the paradox is found decades ago in sociolinguistics. In a classic study, Labov (1966) showed
that when patrons of different department stores were asked to indicate the location of specific
objects located on the ‘fourth floor’, after the experimenter intentionally acted as if he/she had
not understood their initial response, the articulation of /r/ sounds in patron responses ‘fourth’
and ‘floor’ became more pronounced. Changes in one’s pronunciation after social monitoring
support the notion that observation of behaviour, at the sociolinguistic level at least, leads to
alterations in the behaviour itself

Observer’s paradox refers to the paradox that it is not possible to observe something in the condition that it would be in if it were not being observed. This is a problem for anyone who wants to observe something in its ‘natural state’, since the very act of observing it may make it (anything from a virus to a human being) act differently.
