## Computer Science

Matthew Chalmers has observed, Paul Dourish (2004) notes, that computer science is based on philosophical assumptions and arguments that were prevalent before the 1930s. Dourish (2004) continues, 

"Computer-science in practice involves reducing high-level behaviors to low-level, mechanical explanations, formalizing them through pure scientific rationality; in this, computer science reveals its history as part of a positivist, reductionist tradition. Similarly, much of contemporary cognitive science is based on a rigorous Cartesian separation between mind and matter, cognition and action. These are philosophical positions of long standing, dating from the nineteenth century or earlier."

This dualist, positivist, reductionist philosophical approach has been questioned by the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. Such phenomenological quesdtioning informs the embodied interaction approach to human interaction with software systems.
