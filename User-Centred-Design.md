## User-Centred Design

**RELATED TERMS: Co-design; User-driven design; People-centred design; Design practice and functionalism**

User-centred design means that design innovation is focused on usersâ€™ needs and the delivery of new benefits to them in their use of products, services, environments, systems, and so on. A user-centred approach is a strong support to incremental innovation. (Koskinen and Thomson, 2012: 79)
