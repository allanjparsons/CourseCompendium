## Design Paradoxes

RELATED TERMS: 

Rodgers, Inella and Bremner (2017) discuss seven paradoxes of design practice, which they characterise as follows:

*Design is really undisciplined as a discipline 

*The easier it becomes to design, the harder it is to design

*Design has become impoverished by the claim that good design equals good business 

*The originality claimed by design is in reality derivative

*The usefulness of design research lies in its uselessness

*The claim by design to be responsible is irresponsible

*The devotion of design to sustainability is unsustainable
