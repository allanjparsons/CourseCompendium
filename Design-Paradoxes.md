## Design Paradoxes

RELATED TERMS: 

Rodgers, Inella and Bremner (2017) discuss seven paradoxes of design practice, which they characterise as follows:

* Design is very undisciplined as a discipline 

* The easier it becomes to design, the harder it is to design

* Design has become impoverished by the claim that good design equals good business

* The originality claimed by design is in reality derivative

* The usefulness of design research lies in its uselessness

* The claim by design to be responsible is irresponsible

* The devotion of design to sustainability is unsustainable

Steven Vial points to the following paradoxical injunctions to which designers are called upon to respond and resolve:

* The meta-market injunction: Be a socialist and a capitalist at one and the same time!

* The disruptive injunction: Be innovative!

* The global problem-solving injunction: Save the world!
