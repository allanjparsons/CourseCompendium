## Epistemology

**RELATED TERMS: Ontology; 


Epistemology or the theory of knowledge is the branch of philosophy that studies the origin, nature, methods, validity, and limits of human knowledge.

It addresses such questions as:

*   What is knowledge?
*   How is knowledge acquired?
*   What do people know?
*   How do we know what we know?

Narrative environments may question the epistemological foundations of certain common beliefs and may also question the separateness of epistemology and ontology as distinct regions within philosophy, focusing instead on how particular design configurations form complex onto-epistemologies: material existents that articulate situated cultural knowledges and vice versa.

According to Kaiser and Thiele (2014),

"Onto-epistemology departs from discrete, given entities as units of analysis and considers agential forces (selves, cultures, objects, etc.) as processually, relationally and asymmetrically produced (all at once)."

The notion of onto-epistemology brings to attention the situatedness of reasoning, such as that which emerges from the application of quantum probability, as discussed by de Freitas and Sinclair (2018),

"Quantum probability (QP) is simply a way of assigning probabilities to events, but it does so quite differently from classical probability (CP). In other words, it offers an alternative formalization of reasoning with uncertainty. This aternative approach links uncertainty to indeterminacy in ways that open up new onto-epistemologies, better attending to the situatedness of reasoning."
