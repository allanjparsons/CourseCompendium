According to Prabakaran Mahdu (2013), 

"Habitat is not plain place of habitation. It is a field of negotiations. Habitats transform. The network of relationships, changes in membership patterns, transitions in the power and influence of constituents and the micro- politics of negotiations transform habitats. Transformed habitats gravitate the internal sinews and thereby transform the praxis pulsations, persons. The trilogy of habitus, habitat and praxis are indistinguishably related in making each other. A person is the indistinguishable trilogy represented by a name or identity."
