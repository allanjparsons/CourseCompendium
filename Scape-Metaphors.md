## Scape metaphors

RELATED TERMS: 

The suffix -scape has been added to a number of nouns apart from land. They include brandscape, servicescape, experiencescape, technoscape, ethnoscape, financescape, mediascape and ideoscape. Some of these terms may be of value when discussing narrative environments. Alternatively, you may wish to create your own kind of -scape, as a particular kind of narrative environment.

The following books discuss brandscape, servicescape and experiencescape:
