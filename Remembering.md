##Remembering: Mnemonics, Mnemotechne and Memory##

**RELATED TERMS: Vocatives; **

Today’s cognitive science validates what memory practitioners already knew long before Shakespeare’s era: Physical configurations reinforce recollection, whether on the page of a book or the stage of a theater. They even called their spatial art of memory the method of loci, or “places.”

We need constantly to be re-minded, we need constantly to re-call, to be called into recollection.

The mind, without signs in the form of physical markers, tends to wandering and errancy, to a different kind of semiosis. The experience of embodiment, of which the imaginary and dreaming are counterbalances, requires the mnemotechnics of placing.
