##Community Building

**RELATED TERMS: Socially-engaged art**

Lazarus, Seedat and Naidoo (2017) argue that community building harnesses the values of community psychology as a means for addressing social issues such as violence and disorder, drug abuse and poverty, as well as for promoting social justice, basic human rights and the health and well-being of all people. Thus, they assert,

"Community building promotes social transformation and a sense of agency and responsibility; fosters citizen and political participation; improves social structures; creates economic, vocational and educational opportunities; supports families and youth; develops community spirit and consciousness; and fosters a ‘sense of community’ and connectedness." (Lazarus, Seedat and Naidoo, 2017)

More specifically, Lazarus, Seedat and Naidoo identify a critical community building approach which provides ‘troubling knowledge’, while building support networks, and promoting a sense of agency and responsibility, through questioning dominant norms and goals, particularly those around issues of power, oppression and privilege. Central to critically-oriented community building is the process of reflexivity.
