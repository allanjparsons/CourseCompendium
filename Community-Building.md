##Community Building

**RELATED TERMS: Socially-engaged art**

Lazarus, Seedat and Naidoo (2017) argue that community building harnesses the values of community psychology as a means for addressing social issues such as violence and disorder, drug abuse and poverty, as well as for promoting social justice, basic human rights and the health and well-being of all people. Thus, they assert,

"Community building promotes social transformation and a sense of agency and responsibility; fosters citizen and political participation; improves social structures; creates economic, vocational and educational opportunities; supports families and youth; develops community spirit and consciousness; and fosters a ‘sense of community’ and connectedness." (Lazarus, Seedat and Naidoo, 2017)

“A community building process aims to build capacity in neighborhood institutions, strengthen ties among residents, and assist residents to work individually and collectively toward neighborhood change. Community building encompasses a number of dimensions, including: community participation; capacity building; neighborhood governance; collaboration; social capital development; an asset orientation; strengthening civic practices; and addressing deep-rooted issues of race and racism.”
