##Â New Media

RELATED TERMS: 

The phrase new media denotes digital, computerized, and networked information and communication technologies, particularly as used for art, design and communications. New media hve been described as any digital media production that is interactive and digitally distributed.

Such media bring with them the challenge of blending information, education, community and personal expression and the new technologies of production and consumption.

It has been suggested that two fundamental bases distinguish the new media from the media that preceded it, much of which still exists. They concern how the media are transmitted; and how they are accessed. Transmission now integrates text, pictures, video and sound and the increasing use of the Internet as the vehicle; access means interactivity, a defining feature which is likely to be the most significant area for future new media development.
