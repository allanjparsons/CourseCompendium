## Place

RELATED TERMS: 

Narrative environments may be described as places. Places are events; they ‘take place’. Places are both sensible, perceivable by the senses, and intelligible, existing in thought and in the imagination.

In the design of narrative environments, place is intimately related to body and to the differentiations, according to deictic, associative and affective orientations and horizons, among ‘my’ place, ‘your’ place, ‘our place’ and ‘their’ place.

As Cecena (2015) notes, "A place is not a portion of space. Place is the lived expression of the spatial apprehension of reality."
