**RELATED TERMS: Remembering: Mnemonics, Mnemotechne and Memory**

In the context of the design of narrative environments, technologies are understood to be interconnected systems, media or frames, as well as an accumulation or ecology of systems over time. Within these systemic media frames, individual technical artefacts act as a form of memory that constitutes the fabric of human historicity and sociality. They do so by providing the ground of that which is always already there for human beings or, in other words, that into which one has been thrown.  In that sense, following Stiegler (1998), they are a kind of tertiary memory, a particular kind of mnemotechne that differs from secondary memory, such as writing and oral topical techniques (method of loci or method of topoi), as well as the primary memory of human recall as mnemne.

Technicisation is, therefore, not what produces loss or a weakening of memory, a _hypomnêsis_, as is argued in Plato's _Phaedrus_, but rather a different kind of remembering.

Stiegler (2009: 1-2) states that, 

“_The Fault of Epimetheus_ was my attempt to show that this disorientation is _originary_, that humanity’s history is that of technics as a process of exteriorization in which technical evolution is dominated by tendencies that societies must perpetually negotiate. The “technical system” is constantly evolving and rendering the “other systems” that structure social cohesion null and void. Becoming technical is originarily a derivation: socio-genesis recapitulates techno genesis. Techno-genesis is structurally prior to socio-genesis — technics is invention, and invention is innovation — and the adjustment between technical evolution and social tradition always encounters moments of resistance, since technical change, to a greater or lesser extent, disrupts the familiar reference points of which all culture consists.”
