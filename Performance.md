## Performance

RELATED TERMS: Happenings; Performance Art; Performativity; 

The terms performance and performative are important for the design of narrative environments because it is argued they are performed by a participant. This performance takes on a different character depending on the narrative environment itself and may involve a combination of consumption by a consumer, reception by a reader, spectator or audience; or instrumental use by a user, as well as actions and decisions by the participant.

The performativity of the narrative environment may also be discussd in terms of actantiality or actantiality-passantiality.

Richard Schechner conceives of the topics which relate to the term performance as a fan or as a web, as follows:
