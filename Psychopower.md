# Psychopower

**RELATED TERMS: [Biopolitics and Biopower](https://github.com/narrative-environments/CourseCompendium/blob/main/Biopolitics-and-Biopower.md)**

According to Ekin Erkan (2019: 218), while biopower may sufficiently explain the kinds of neuroses troubling citizens in the mid-to-late 20th century, psychopower in contrast is globalized and diffracted. As a system, it encompasses the organization of the capture of attention made possible by the psychotechnologies developed gradually through radio in the early 20th century, television in the mid-20th century and digital technologies in the late 20th century. Psychopower results in the massive destruction of attention, exacerbated by '24/7 capitalism', "where generalized human life is inscribed into duration without breaks and defined by a principle of continuous functioning (and sleeplessness)."
