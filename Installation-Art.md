## Installation Art

**RELATED TERMS: Sculpture**

The term installation is usually applied to arrangements of materials and/or media in interior spaces, whereas exterior interventions are often called land art. However, the boundaries between these categories are fluid. 

Installation artworks have been constructed in exhibition spaces such as museums and galleries, as well as public and private spaces. The genre incorporates a very broad range of everyday and natural materials, which are often chosen for their evocative qualities, as well as media such as video, sound, performance, interactive media, virtual reality and the internet. 

Many installations are site-specific in that they are designed to only exist in the location for which they were created, taking into account such things as the nature, attributes, purpose and prior use of that space.
