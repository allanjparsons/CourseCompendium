## Praxis

**RELATED TERMS: Poeisis; Reflexivity and Reflection**

The term _praxis_ is one of Aristotle’s three main categories action, alongside _poiesis_ and _theoria_. Praxis is taken to mean doing or acting, rather than making (poiesis) or thinking (theoria), although 'thinking' here is restricted to thinking about 'universals'. Each form of action is associated with a characteristic form of knowing: theoria with episteme (knowledge of universals); poiesis with techne; and praxis with phronesis.

For Marx and later Marxist writers, praxis is contrasted with wage labour. Praxis is free, conscious, creative human activity, which alone is capable of generating knowledge and creating change in the social order.

Interesting contributions to the concept of praxis have been made by Jurgen Habermas and, particularly, Hannah Arendt, who revises Aristotle’s and Marx’s categorisations in her discussion of labour, work and action.
