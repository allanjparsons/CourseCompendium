## Telectroscope

RELATED TERMS:

The Telectroscope was on display and open to the public 24-hours-a-day in London and New York from 22 May to 15 June 2008. It allowed Londoners and New Yorkers to see each other in real time. It was produced by Artichoke, developed from an idea by Paul St George. 

The conceit was that Londoners and New Yorkers could see one another at either end of a trans-Atlantic tunnel, but in reality the effect was achieved through a trans-Atlantic broadband network rounded off on each end with HD cameras.
