## Intertextuality

RELATED TERMS: 

Intertextuality is the shaping of texts’ meanings by other texts. It can refer to an author’s borrowing and transformation of a prior text or to a reader’s referencing of one text in reading another.

In popular culture, intertextuality refers to the incorporation of meanings of one text within another in a reflexive fashion. For example, the television show _The Simpsons_ includes references to films, other television shows, and celebrities. These intertextual references assume that the viewer know the people and cultural products being referenced.
