## Sensory Design

RELATED TERMS:

Nathan Shedroff defines sensory design as the employment of all techniques with which we communicate to others through our senses. Writing, visual design techniques in disciplines such as graphic design, videography, cinematography, typography, illustration, and photography are usually the first to be recognized and employed. However, the disciplines that communicate through other senses are equally important. Sound design and engineering or musical and vocal performance, for example, are also useful in the appropriate circumstances and sometimes may be the only appropriate media for communicating a particular message. Tactile, olfactory, and kinesthetic senses are rarely employed, due to technological or market constraints, but are just as valid and can add enriching detail to an experience.
