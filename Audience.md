Audience comes from the latin _audire_ meaning to hear. Nonetheless, it is used in film, theatre and performance to describe what might more naturally be called the spectators or viewers, as it is sight that tends to be prioritise in these media.

An audience consists of one person or more usually a group of people who have gathered to experience a work that is presented to them. While each person has their own experience, they also share a collective experience, at a performance of theatre, music, dance or other performance formats; or the screening of a film. 

It is also used as a collective noun to refer to the remote and dispersed groups who experience mass media broadcasts, such as those of television and radio. 

The term can also be applied to the readership of a book, newspaper or other printed publication.

From audience to participant

In the context of the design of narrative environments, if the participation in such an environment takes the form of being an audience, this is at the more 'passive' end of the spectrum, although this still requires participation, for example, in the form of being able to read and decode the meanings that the text or performance articulates. Many narrative environments require a more 'active' form of participation, both at the level of physical movement and at the level of intellectual engagement. The term audience seems to imply that the person or persons attending remain still and/or seated with the body disengaged from the intellect. At the level of intellectual engagement, the narrative environment invites the participant to take part in the meaning production, not simply to receive a fully-developed moral or conclusion, and be ready to learn, in which case the narrative environment is also a learning environment with its own pedagogic strategies and techniques. It is through this combined physical and intellectual movement, with its various forms of synaesthesia, that a narrative environment articulates its emotional import and its truth values.
