## Mimesis in [Narrative environment design]

Communication of something by imitation or representation, as opposed to diegesis: communication of something by narration or report.

Mimesis and diegesis are very sharply separated in Aristotle’s account and thence in literary theory and narratology.

Things are not so clear cut in Narrative Environment Design. Many Narrative Environments incorporate mimesis in their ‘telling’ or narration’ strategy. In which case one could say that the mimesis becomes part of the diegesis of the Narrative Environment.
