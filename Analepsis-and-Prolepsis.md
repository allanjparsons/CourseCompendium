# Analepsis and Prolepsis

**RELATED TERMS: [Tragic theatre - Aristotle](https://github.com/narrative-environments/CourseCompendium/blob/main/Tragic-Theatre.md)**

A Greek tragedy usually starts with a ‘flashback’ or analepsis, a recapitulation of the incidents of the story which occurred prior to those which were selected for the plot. The reader is plunged in medias res (‘into the middle of things’), and earlier incidents in the story are introduced artfully at various stages in the plot, often in the form of retrospective narration. (Selden, Widdowson and Brooker, 2005: 34)

It is analepsis which allows for prolepsis, or 'flash forward', to various other moments in the narration by means of which the story is unfolded through the plot.

In the design of narrative environments, such plot movements back and forth in time against a story timeline may be parallelled or contradicted by the spatial movements of the body against the contours of place.
