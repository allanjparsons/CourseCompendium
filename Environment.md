## Environment

**RELATED TERMS: Habitat; Niche**

Environment is the name given to the outcome of the active processes of environing, which create an immunological sphere in Sloterdijk's terms and which thereby create a meaningful context for the actants who are engaged in creating, sustaining and changing it. Environment, in this sense, is close to the notions of habitat and niche.

One limited, motivated view of what environment is expressed by Fred Dust, Head of Environments at IDEO San Francisco. He says environment is

“the space, services and protocols of people who use it plus the information and technology processed and displayed in it”
