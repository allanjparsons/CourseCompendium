## CSM Exhibition 2008

In June 2008, graduating students' work was shown in Park Town, an exhibition that transformed the car park in the CSM building in Southampton Row, where the college was located at that time, into a town square. The projects were displayed in the post office, launderette, theatre, school, and so on, surrounding the central green. Park Town also represented the community and network that the students had built over their time in the college.
