# Heterarchy

A heterarchy, Dekker and Kuchar (2017) state, is a complex adaptive system of governance which is ordered by more than one governing principle. In other words, it is a multi-level structure in which there is no single 'highest level'. While heterarchies include elements of hierarchies and networks, they are different from both of these systems of governance in a number of important ways. An analogy might be made between heterarchical governance and plate tectonics: they are mutually self-contained orders with unclear hierarchies among them.

The concept of heterarchy was created by neurophysiologist Warren S. McCulloch (1945) in response to a problem defined by a logical contradiction that is characteristic for any system, whether it be a group of neurons, an individual or an organization, that chooses A instead of B, B instead of C and C instead of A. To make this clearer, Ogilvy (2016) suggests that, "The term 'heterarchy' is best defined by its opposition to hierarchy. In a hierarchy, if A is over B, and B is over C, then A is over C -- your basic pecking order. In a heterarchy, though, you can have A over B, B over C, and C over A." To think of how this works in practice, Ogilvy gives the example of the game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors', where paper covers rock; rock crushes scissors; and scissors cut paper.

This value anomaly is present in any system that has to make a choice between two or more potential acts that are incompatible (McCulloch 1945, 90; cf. Shackle 1979). Without the logical contradiction, that is, without two or more potential acts that are incompatible, there is no space for a genuine choice based on disparate evaluation criteria (Dekker and Kuchar, 2017).

**Heterarchy and the design of narrative environments**

For narrative environments that are designed in order to highlight such value anomalies, for example, among rational financial gain, social justice and environmental sustainability, the concept of heterarchy may be very useful for working through how contradictory behaviours, which emerge from the series of choices that a system makes in accordance with different evaluation criteria, are managed by the system so that it does not fall into paralysis through conflict, radical doubt or anomie.
