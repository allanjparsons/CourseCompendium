## Physical Anthropology

RELATED TERMS: Anthropology

Physical anthropology has re-positioned itself in recent decades within the larger field of evolutionary biology. Along with this repositioning, it has developed and incorporated new techniques as well as the recognition of broader responsibilities in the modern world. Many programmes formerly known as “physical anthropology” have changed their names, most commonly to biological anthropology. A more accurate name might be “evolutionary anthropology,” reflecting the fact that the core of the discipline is the study of human evolution and that the guiding theoretical framework is evolutionary theory (Ellison, 2018).
