## Layout

RELATED TERMS: Graphic Design

In graphic design, layout refers to the arrangement of elements on a page usually meaning the specific placement of image, text and style, organising the flow and order of information.  Most designers and advertisers apply the 'Z' layout. This structure, in the form of letter Z, traces the path in which the reader views the elements on the page, advertisement or design: from headline, imagery, body copy, captions and signature or call to action.
