# Posthumanities

**RELATED TERMS: Posthumanism; Postanthropocentrism; Posthuman;**

According to Rosi Braidotti, critical posthumanities is an emergent field of enquiry based on the convergence of posthumanism and postanthropocentrism. Posthumanism develops a critique of the humanist ideal of ‘Man’: Vitruvian 'Man' as the allegedly universal measure of all things. Postanthropocentrism criticizes species hierarchy and human exceptionalism.
