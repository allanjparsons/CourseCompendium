## Poeisis

RELATED TERMS: 

_Poiesis_ is a Greek term that means making, producing, creation, creative power or ability. _Poiesis_ is contrasted with _praxis_, which means ‘doing’ or ‘acting’, by Plato and Aristotle. Excellent making requires _techne_, skill, while excellent doing requires _arete_, virtue.

The question for the design of narrative environments is whether the design process and the design outcome are modes of production or modes of action or, indeed, a mixture of both.

The distinction between poiesis and praxis is developed by Hannah Arendt, through a re-reading of Heidegger's _Being and Time_, when she distinguishes among labour, work and action. For Arendt, labour simply reproduces the labourer and leaves no trace in the world; it is through work that the world is made and re-made in its material form; while it is through action that the political and the ethical dimensions of social existence are realised as spheres of human practice. 

The important question to pose of a narrative environment is how it takes part in the work of (re-)making the world and how it acts ethically and politically (and upon whom or what)?
