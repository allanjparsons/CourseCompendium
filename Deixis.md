## Deixis and Indexicality

RELATED TERMS:

Narrative environments, as a cultural practice, involve cascades of deixis, similar to that found in theatre. In theatre, as Brandt (2016) explains, the first instance is the framing deixis of theatricality: “I am now acting, and not behaving naturally”. The second instance is the narrative deixis: “I am now playing the role of a character in the story X”. The third instance is the aesthetic deixis: “I am shaping this role in a certain way and signing this version as “this way” of
playing it here now”.
