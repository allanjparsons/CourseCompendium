## Venetian Atmospherics

RELATED TERMS: 

Venetian Atmospherics by Thomas Putrih <[http://www.putrih.net/](http://www.putrih.net/)> is both an architectural project and a sculpture, a viewing machine meant to create and encourage perceptual illusions. Its title is a homage to architect John Eberson’s atmospheric cinema interior design of the 1920s, which gave the spectators the impression to sit under a nocturnal sky in an exotic site. Designed with biomorphically curved wooden walls and a ceiling with twinkling stars and moving clouds, Putrih’s cinema immerses the spectator in an ever-changing environment, ready to give space to the cinematic illusions projected in it.
