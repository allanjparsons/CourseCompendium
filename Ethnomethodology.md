## Ethnomethodology

**RELATED TERMS: Actor-Network Theory; Anthropology; Ethnography; Method and methodology; Sociology; Participants**

Ethnomethodology is an approach within sociology initiated by Harold Garfinkel. It seeks to uncover the methods and social competence that people, as members of social groups, employ in constructing their sense of social reality.

Ethnomethodology is mentioned by Bruno Latour (2005, fn. 54, p. 54) in a footnote in _Reassembling the Social_, as being one of the sources of actor network theory. Latour writes, “It would be fairly accurate to describe ANT as being half Garfinkel and half Greimas …”
