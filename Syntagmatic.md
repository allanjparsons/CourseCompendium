–Syntagmatic structure is “the mode of time-awareness which listeners are placed” such as ‘[narrative’, ‘[epic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry "Epic poetry")’, or ‘[lyrical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrical "Lyrical")’. 

A **Syntagma** is one syntactic or syntagmatic element. Narrative structures feature a realistic temporal flow guided by tension and relaxation, privilege [difference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference "Difference"), and “as [diegesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegesis "Diegesis"), songs speak to or address us by organizing a particular stretch of time into a conscious experience, and an experience of consciousness” (Cubitt 1984, p.216). 

Epic structures tend to the opposite, privileging [repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition "Repetition"), creating a [mythic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology") state of recurrence, and “emptying out” the subject (ibid, p.216-17). 

Lyrical structures lie in between and feature [symmetrical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetrical "Symmetrical") open/closed and[binary forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_form "Binary form"). (Middleton 1990, p.251 and 217)
