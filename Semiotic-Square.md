She notes that, in alliance with Bruno Latour, she will use "this clackety, structuralist meaning-making machine" to create a narrative other than "the rational progress of science, in potential league with progressive politics, patiently unveiling a grounding nature. Equally, she will not create a tale that will be a demonstration of the social construction of science and nature that locates all agency firmly on the side of humanity.
