## Implicit Narrative

**RELATED TERMS: Narratology**

A narrative that is not overtly told but is read through cultural signs. Religious buildings often embody implicit narratives. 

Another radically different example of a vehicle for an implicit is the traditional Japanese toilet, a narrative of our connection to nature and its cycles of consumption, growth and decay. In this context, it is worth reading pages 3-5 of _In Praise of Shadows_by Junchiro Tanizaki.
