## Implicit Narrative

**RELATED TERMS: Narratology**

A narrative that is not overtly told but is read through cultural signs. Religious buildings often embody implicit narratives. 

Another radically different example of a vehicle for an implicit is the traditional Japanese toilet, a narrative of our connection to nature and its cycles of consumption, growth and decay, as described by Junchiro Tanizaki (1977: 3-5).
