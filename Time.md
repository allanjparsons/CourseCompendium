## Time

**RELATED TERMS: Space**

The ancient Greeks had two words for time: _chronos_ and _kairos_. _Chronos_ means absolute time, linear, chronological and quantifiable. _Kairos_, on the other hand, means qualitative time, the time of opportunity, chance and mischance. For example, if you go to bed because the clock says it is 10.30pm, you are adhering to a chronological time system. If you go to sleep because you are tired, you are following kairological or event time. 

We are all born with a sense of event time, which is at once subjective and culturally objective. 

Hans Ramo (1999) discusses these two ancient Greek concepts of time along with heir corresponding concepts of space: _chora_ (or _khora_) and _topos_.
