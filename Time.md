## Time

**RELATED TERMS: Space; Rhythm**

From the perspective of the design of narrative environments, the relationship between narrative, time and the human is established by Paul Ricoeur (1984, p.3) who argues that,

'time becomes human time to the extent that it is organized after the manner of a narrative; narrative, in turn, is meaningful to the extent that it portrays the features of temporal experience.' 

The ancient Greeks had two words for time: _chronos_ and _kairos_. _Chronos_ means absolute time: linear, chronological and quantifiable. _Kairos_, on the other hand, means qualitative time: the time of opportunity, chance and mischance. For example, if you wake up because the alarm says it is 7.30am, you are adhering to a chronological time system (clock time). If you wake up because have had sufficient sleep, you are following kairological or event time (perhaps, circadian time). 

The concept of rhythm become relevant here and of (rhythmic) times within (linear, unfolding) times, reversible and irreversible time, recurrent and unrepeatable times, circular and linear directionality of time, time-asymmetry and time-symmetry; in relation to possible worlds. 

We are all born with a sense of event time, which is at once subjective and culturally objective. 

Hans Ramo (1999) discusses these two ancient Greek concepts of time along with their corresponding concepts of space, _chora_ (or _khora_) and _topos_, in conjunction with the Aristoelian notions of action and the kind of knowledge with which those modes of action are associated: theoria (contemplation of universals) and episteme (knowledge of universals, 'scientific' knowledge); poiesis (making, producing) and techne (skill, know-how, proficiency); and praxis (action, inter-action) and phronesis (practical wisdom, judgement). He develops four possible time-spaces: Chronochora (abstract time-abstract space), chronotopos (abstract time-meaningful space), kairochora (meaningful time-abstract space) and kairotopos (meaningful time-meaningful space).
