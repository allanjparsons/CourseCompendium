Erwin Wurm is a renowned Austrian artist. In 2006, he created “House Attack”, an artistic installation on the external side of the building of the Museum Moderner Kunst (MUMOK) in Vienna.

“House Attack” confounds our perception of art and everyday reality. In its striking appearance and humorous, dramatic staging of the banal, it is a good example of current developments in Wurm’s work.
