## Things

**RELATED TERMS: Collecting; Material Culture; Representation; Narrative Ecology**

Since the late 20th century, there has been a 'return to things' in the social sciences and humanities, to the extent that Bill Brown, a scholar of American literature, has called for a 'thing theory'. This movement contravenes an earlier focus on representation and the long scholarly tradition that separated subject from object, mind from matter. Among these  approaches, human existence and social life is understood to depend on material things and are entangled with them. People and things are relationally produced. (Hodder, 2014)

The design of narrative environments is in accord with this perspective.

While accepting this perspective, Hodder nevertheless points out that the focus on dependence rather than on relationality draws attention to the ways in which humans may be entrapped in and by their relations with things: humans are caught in a double bind, depending on things that depend on humans. Hodder defines this as 'entanglement'.

For the design of narrative environments, this constitutes a 'tangled hierarchy'.

In a narrative ecology perspective, things are designed objects, products or services, with specific roles. As actors, things exert a design-centered view of the world of activities and the meaningful relationships which participants have with it.
