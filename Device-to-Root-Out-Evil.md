## Device to root out evil

This piece of artwork by American sculptor Dennis Oppenheim, entitled _Device to Root Out Evil,_ now stands as an upside-down church in Glenbrow, Canada. It was formerly displayed in Vancouver, but controversy over it blocking the ocean view of where it stood caused it to be moved.

Oppenheim maintains that his interest is in exploring the dialogue between architecture and sculpture. From the perspective of narrative environments, _Device to Root Out Evil_ combines architecture with narrativity or discursively. Furthermore, much like Erwin Wurm’s “House Attack” in Vienna, _Device to Root Out Evil_ juxtaposes the familiar with the unexpected within a mundane or everyday setting

Oppenheim argues that turning the church upside down makes it more aggressive but not, in his opinion, blasphemous. Given its title, this is very much up for debate.
