## Ortakoy installation Istanbul

RELATED TERMS: 

In one of the projects for the 2008-2010 cohort of narrative environment students, they made the Ortakoy installation as part of the City and Art project in Istanbul March 2009.

As so often happens, the facades of the streets in Istanbul are being hidden, driven by the desire for newness. The project examined how traditions change, how regeneration happens and how modernity is materialised.
