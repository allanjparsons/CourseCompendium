## Space

RELATED TERMS:

Space is abstract, in contrast to place, which is concrete. Nevertheless, both space and place are capable of acting in a narrative environment, of being actants.

A location or a site is a space that does not have placeness or placiality.

**Discussion:**

How useful could the ancient Greek notions of _chora_ and _topos_, alongside the two ancient Greek conceptions of time, _kairos_ and _chronos_, be in developing an understanding of how time and space can be configured in the design of narrative environments, moving from the relatively abstract to the more meaningful? Perhaps Hans Ramo's diagram might be of value on this context:

## Space in Narrative Ecology

A space can be defined as an actor [Actant] embodied in the virtual or physical built environment, and therefore exerting a presence that can be defined in terms of a spatial analysis of light, volume, obstacles and flow routines, amongst others.
