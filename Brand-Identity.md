## Brand Identity and Brand Image

Brand identity is the visible elements of a brand, such as its name, its logo, the colours, shapes and other design elements its uses in its products and in its marketing and the language it uses in its advertising. These elements identify and distinguish the brand. The ways in which they are articulated aim to cultivate a certain brand image in the minds of consumers. 

The contrast between brand identity and brand image may be considered as parallel to the distinction between the world of the story, the elements presented in narration, and the storyworld, the world that the reader-participant constructs from those elements.

Stuart Jones writes: 

A sophisticated person working in branding will understand that a brand identity, like all identities, is a compact between the brand owner and the consumer (see ‘authorship’ in this compendium, postmodernism, and various debates in psychology and philosophy). Brand owners might prefer something more along the ‘Great Tradition’ hegemony lines, but tough. The generation of a robust brand identity is supported by the construction of a brand narrative that acknowledges, teases out, and supports consumer participation in the creation of the identity.
