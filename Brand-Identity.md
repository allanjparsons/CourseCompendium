## Brand Identity and Brand Image

Brand Identity is how the brand owner wants the consumer to perceive the brand – and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity.Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand’s differentiation from competitors.

A sophisticated person working in branding will understand that a brand identity, like all identities, is a compact between the brand owner and the consumer (see ‘authorship’ in this thesaurus, postmodernism, and various debates in psychology and philosophy). Brand owners might prefer something more along the ‘Great Tradition’ hegemony lines, but tough. The generation of a robust brand identity is supported by the construction of a brand narrative that acknowledges, teases out, and supports consumer participation in the creation of the identity.
