## Transmedia, Cross-Platform and Multimedia

**RELATED TERMS: Affordances; Mode and Medium**

The design of narrative environments generally is considered to be a transmedia practice, taking advantage of the affordances offered by different media, from architectural, to artefactual, pictorial and written, so that the visitor-particioant has to work to piece the content together from each platform, but this does not mean that it may not on occasion also utilise cross-platform distribution or multimedia capabilities.

Henry Jenkins (2016) contends that it is important to distinguish among the terms transmedia, cross-platform and multimedia. 

Transmedia, as an adjective, refers to some kind of structured relationship between different media platforms and practices. 

**Transmedia** approaches are:

  * multimodal - they deploy the affordances of more than one medium; 
  * intertextual - each platform offers unique content that contributes to our experience of the whole; and 
  * dispersed  - the viewer constructs an understanding of the core ideas through encounters across multiple platforms.

**Cross-Platform** refers to the channel of delivery or means of distribution, such as cinema release, online streaming or sale of DVDs. The different channels are not related additively but are simply alternatives for each another. The reader-spectator need not visit all of these hubs; one will suffice. They will not learn anything new, content-wise, by viewing them all.

**Multimedia** refers to the case where a single app or website might include video, audio, text, and simulations. The example of a multimedia project cited by Jenkins is [Snow Fall](https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html#/?part=tunnel-creek) in the _New York Times_. 

A transmedia project, on the other hand, would distribute these experiences across platforms so that the audience has actively to work to assemble the pieces, often through networked interpretation.
