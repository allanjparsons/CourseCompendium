Contributed by by Madina Safina

Since the late 1980s, the group exhibition has become the primary site for curatorial experimentation, generating a new discursive space around artistic practice. The group exhibition runs counter to the canonical model of the monographic presentation. By bringing a greater mix of people into an exhibition, it also creates a space for defining multifarious ways of engaging with disparate interests, often within a more trans-cultural context. Group exhibitions are ideological texts which make private intentions public.
