# Terraforming

**RELATED TERMS: World-forming, World-making, World-building**

The name of the architectural practice, Terreform, was derived from the combination of "terre", meaning earth or soil, and "reform", meaning to rebuild, reconstruct or recreate. The founders sought to differentiate their practice from that of "terraforming". In planetary engineering, terraforming is a process of transforming an alien atmosphere to create a habitable living environment for humans. Instead of contriving to copy of the Earth's atmosphere elsewhere, as the notion of "terraform" commonly implies, Terreform seeks to reform the planet Earth in place. Their intention is "to repair the atmosphere of our world by fostering designs that reform the current pollution causing global trends."

Similarly, Benjamin Bratton (2019) in _The Terraforming_, a short polemical book that serves as the basis for an urban design research programme at the Strelka Institute in Moscow, also notes that “terraforming” is usually taken to refer to the re-shaping of the ecosystems of other planets or moons in order to make them capable of supporting Earth-like life. However, he suggests, the ecological consequences of the Anthropocene mean that, in the coming decades, we will need to terraform the planet Earth itself, that is, if it is to remain a viable host for its own life.

**Discussion**

The planetary, the global and the world may need to be distinguished as terms that refer to some sort of autopoietic 'whole', in relation to the discussion about the distinction between (neoliberal) globalisation and alternative forms of 'mondialisation' ('new world order'), to cite a term used by Jean-Luc Nancy and Jacques Derrida among others. The 'project', if such it can be called, is ecological and political at once.
