## Land Art

**RELATED TERMS: Environmental Art; Sculpture**

According to Domínguez Rubio (2012), land art produces art objects by letting go of things, while for the Tate, "land art or earth art is art that is made directly in the landscape, sculpting the land itself into earthworks or making structures in the landscape using natural materials such as rocks or twigs." It was was part of the wider conceptual art movement in the 1960s and 1970s. Its most well-known exponents include Richard Long, Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt, Walter de Maria, Michael Heizer and Dennis Oppenheim. The complex relationships among sculpture, architecture and landscape, as they unfolded in the 1960s and 1970s, are explored by Rosalind Krauss
