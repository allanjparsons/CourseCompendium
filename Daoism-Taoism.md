## Daoism - Taoism

The notion of _dao_ (tao), in as far as it indicates a path, a way or a set of principles, may have importance for considering the kind of pathway or passage that occurs in a narrative environment. Also, reference to the _dao_ is important in highlighting that a narrative environment is always, to some extent, a learning environment, because, as the _Xueji_ (_On Teaching and Learning)_ asserts, “A person will never come to understand the Dao without learning”. Similarly, engagement with or participation in a narrative environment involves learning.

As Di (2016: 45) explains, the character _dao_ literally means the road one travels, but it also signifies the journey one takes in life. Furthermore, _dao_ signifies a holistic conception of humans and nature, a humanistic worldview that forms the basis of ancient Chinese thought. The term _dao_ (tao) is very widely used in ancient Chinese philosophical texts. From its literal meaning of ‘way’ or ‘path’, it is a short step to its use to mean ‘way of doing something’ and hence to mean ‘principle’ or ‘set of principles’. (Wilkinson, 1997: viii)

It is in the sense of ‘set of principles’ that it is used in the _Analects_ of Confucius. To follow the _dao_ in Confucian terms is to follow the set of moral principles expounded in that text (Wilkinson, 1997: viii). For Confucius, the essence of education is to study, pursue, and live the _dao_, and to teach and learn holistically (Di, 2016: 45).

In order to effect a translation of the principles of the _dao_ into human daily learning, experience, and existence, _Xueji_, like many Chinese classic writings, advocates the cultivation of character and moral development (Di, 2016: 47).

While, in Daoism, the term ‘Dao’ is used to mean way, path and set of principles, it also has another sense. The fundamental assertion of Daoist philosophy is that there is an ultimate reality, and this is referred to as the _Dao_, as something formless yet complete, something that is real, ultimate and in some way the basis of all there is.

Dao in narrative environments, while it exploits the senses of path and set of principles and implies learning, does not necessarily imply a belief in an ultimate ground or an ultimate reality; unless that ultimate ground is understood not as a prior grounding but as a simultaneous modality of ‘chaos’ or ‘spontaneity’.
