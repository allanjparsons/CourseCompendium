## Landscape Design

**RELATED TERMS: Architecture; **

Landscape designs are guided by the principles that determine the way in which the garden components are used. For example, in Chinese gardens the guiding principle is unity, which determines the relationships among rocks, plants and water; for Andre Le Notre, a famous 17th Century French designer, a very important principle
was that of symmetry; while for Capability Brown, an influential 18th century English landscaper, the most important principle was for landscapes to be natural in appearance.

Landscape design may involve some of the concepts with which narrative environments is also engaged, such as perspective and focalisation, the relationship between narrator and beholder and the notion of 'narrative vision', which cuts across the distinction between the textual and the visual, implying a specific narrative experience, as discussed by Jan Kenneth Birksted.
