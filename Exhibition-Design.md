## Exhibition Design

RELATED TERMS: 

Herbert Bayer, writing in 1961, states that exhibitions are generally temporary nature and are often experimental, whose content may vary from a presentation of the beer industry, the history of transport or humanity's religious aspirations. Exhibitions are of many different kinds: educational and cultural exhibitions; museums; art exhibitions; street-window displays; and trade fairs. Crucially, Bayer notes, "[e]ach of these categories poses different problems and demands different handling."

As an emerging professional discipline, Bayer notes that the task of exhibition designers is to play with the resources at their disposal: "The total application of all plastic and psychological means (more than anything else) makes exhibition design an intensified and new language. It becomes integrated use of graphics with architectural structure, of advertising psychology with space concepts, of light and color with motion and sound."
