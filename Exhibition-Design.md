## Exhibition Design

RELATED TERMS: 

Herbert Bayer, writing in 1961, states that exhibitions are generally temporary nature and are often experimental, whose content may vary from a presentation of the beer industry, the history of transport or humanity's religious aspirations. Exhibitions are of many different kinds: educational and cultural exhibitions; museums; art exhibitions; street-window displays; and trade fairs. Crucially, Bayer notes, "[e]ach of these categories poses different problems and demands different handling."
