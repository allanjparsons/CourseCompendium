## Interaction

**RELATED TERMS: Interaction Design; Performative; Actant**

Interaction, a mutual and progressive exchange between two or more entities, human or otherwise, is a key feature of narrative environments. The overall pattern of this interaction may be called a field of actantiality or performativity, indicating its dynamic, networked or systemic character.


In interaction design, which arose in the context of human-computer, human-machine or human-technology interaction, the interaction is a two-way exchange which may be person-to-person, machine-to-machine or person-to-machine. It is typified by this reponsivity and also by being characterisable as a sequence of exchanges.
